# Economics Meets Machine Learning -- Seasons of Code
This project involves implementing various Economics problems as a Markov Decision Process in a compact way as Gym. Later we implemented Bandit and Reinforcement Learning algorithms to solve these problems. Some economic problems that we dealt with include Matching Markets, Auctions, and allocation problems. Matching Markets has applications in ridesharing, online dating, job matching, kidney exchange, and university applications. Auctions are everywhere, from IPL team selection to online advertising, spectrum allocation to art auctions, government procurement, and online marketplaces.

## Timeline of the Project
- Weeks 1-2: Learnt about different types of MDPs, Bandit Algorithms, and some RL algorithms
- Week 3: Basic familiarity with Gym implementation and GitHub Setup
- Week 4: Introduction to different economic problems and their mathematical models
- Week 5: Implementng Econ problem as a Gym Environment
- Weeks 6-7: Integrating Bandit or RL Algorithms
- Week 8: Benchmarking against Heuristic Approaches
